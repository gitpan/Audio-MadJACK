=head1 NAME

Audio::MadJACK - Talk to MadJACK server using Object Oriented Perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Audio::MadJACK;

  my $mj = new Audio::MadJACK( 'osc.udp://madjack.example.net/' );
  $mj->load( 'Playlist_A/mymusic.mp3' );
  $mj->play();


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Audio::MadJACK module uses Net::LibLO to talk to a 
MadJACK (MPEG Audio Deck) server. It has an Object Oriented style 
API making it simple to control multiple decks from a single script.


=over 4

=item B<new( oscurl )>

A ping is sent to the MadJACK deck to check to see if it is there.
If a reply is not recieved or there was an error then C<undef> is returned.

=item B<load( filename )>

Send a message to the deck requesting that C<filename> is loaded.
Note: it is up to the developer to check to see if the file was 
successfully loaded, by calling the C<get_state()> method.

Returns 1 if command was successfully received or 0 on error.

=item B<play()>

Tell the deck to start playing the current track.

Returns 1 if command was successfully received or 0 on error.

=item B<pause()>

Tell the deck to pause the current track.

Returns 1 if command was successfully received or 0 on error.

=item B<stop()>

Tell the deck to stop decoding and playback of the current track.

Returns 1 if command was successfully received or 0 on error.

=item B<cue()>

Tell the deck to start decoding from the cue point.

Returns 1 if command was successfully received or 0 on error.

=item B<eject()>

Close the currect track loaded.

Returns the filename of the track currently loaded in the deck.
The filename is stripped of its path and suffix.

If no track is currently loaded then an empty string is returned.
If no reply if received from the server or there is an error then 
C<undef> is returned.

=item B<get_filepath()>

Returns the file path of the track currently loaded in the deck 
(path will be in the same form as originally passed to load()).

If no track is currently loaded then an empty string is returned.
